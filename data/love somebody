There's a new wind blowin' like I've never known.
G# E D# C# B B G# B B C#
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done.
B B B B C# E, C# B B C# C# B B G#
And it sure feels good, to finally feel the way I do.
Byeah B B B B E G# B,
I wanna love somebody,
C# B G# F# G# E

Yeah, I wanna feel the sunshine,

Shinin' down on me and you.

When you put your arms around me,

You let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do.


I used to run in circles goin' no-where fast.
I'd take, uh, one step forward end up two steps back.
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to, mmm, mmm.
I wanna love somebody,
Love somebody like you.

Whoa here we go now!
