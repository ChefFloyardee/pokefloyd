Summer came and left without a warning
D D D F F Bb Bb Bb C C D
All at once I looked and you were gone
D G G G F F D# D# F
And now you're looking back at me

Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

D D D D D G Bb D D C
Now I'm back to what I knew before you

Somehow the city doesn't look the same

I'd give my life for one more night

Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please

Take me there again

Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me

Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye

I remember every moment of those endless summer nights
